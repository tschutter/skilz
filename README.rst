Programming puzzles to exercise your coding-fu.

The Rules
---------

On Monday (ish) of every week, someone will toss out a programming
puzzle. On Friday (ish), we will have a little "brown bag" lunch thing
to show off our individual solutions to the puzzle. This will not be
"graded", reflect on anyone's performance review, or have any impact
on your professional status.

In more detail, here are the rules (or as many as we have thought up thus far):

* Working code is cool, but algorithms are fine too.
* Don't put in more effort than an hour or so and don't let this
  exercise ever interfere with actual work.
* Any language is fair game.
* This is not a competition, but strong Kung Fu will be respected.
* Magic tricks, doubly so.
* During show-and-tell, only positive comments are allowed. Friendly
  trash talk will only be allowed between those that have successfully
  solved the puzzle.
* This isn't about coding standards. Anyone who brings up coding
  standard violations will be banished from show-and-tell and their
  brown bag lunch confiscated.
* Brown bag lunch will probably involve ordering in pizza or other
  yummies because none of us will remember to pack a lunch.
* Admission to show-and-tell is not restricted to entrants only. In
  other words, you can still come and watch without being compelled to
  show your own.
* It is totally not acceptable to pull answers off the internet or use
  books for more than API or language references. Also, no fair
  calling up buddies at Intel/Microsoft/NASA/Google/...

Write a program in any language that takes a integer parameter n and
outputs each number from 0 to n in random order where each number
appears only once.

Find all the two-word compound words in a dictionary. A two-word
compound word is a word in the dictionary that is the concatenation of
exactly two other words in the dictionary. Assume input will be a
number of lowercase words, one per line, in alphabetical order,
numbering around, say, 100K. Generate output consisting of all the
compound words, one per line, in alphabetical order.

Given any integer 0 <= n <= 10000 not divisible by 2 or 5, find the
number of digits in the smallest multiple of n that is a number which
in decimal notation is a sequence of 1's.
